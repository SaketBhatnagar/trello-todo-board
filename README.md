- Added visual feedback for all user interactions
- Used a clean, minimal design with clear visual hierarchy
- Implemented responsive design for all screen sizes

### Performance

- Optimistic updates for better user experience
- Efficient state management with React hooks
- Proper error handling and loading states

   - Add task labels and tags
   - Add task comments
   - Implement task history

2. **Technical**:
   - Add real backend integration
   - Implement user authentication
